 ## Metaphor

 * Work on the same table, talking, exchanginig paper sheets, showing each other links, etc.
 * Repeatedly, forming smaller groups to explore some things, etc.
 * Keep an archive of what was said, shown, etc. to review, quote, edit or for those who arrive latter
 
 BUT 

 * Remove as many time and space barriers as possible
 * Without adding new ones as network, CPU, memory or software requirements

 **Imagine** 

 * GoogleDrive/Docs + WhatsApp Chat integrated in a single app + Chats saved in the same Drive for later access.
 * What makes it **a call** from this "shared files and folders" infrastructure is
    * Keeping shared items together on a topic/channel 
    * Letting participants focus their **attention** on a topic/channel e.g. to autoplay audio
 
 ## Design

 1. Participants exchange **MediaItems**: text, images, audio, forms, links, ...
    1. Each MediaItem can be shown as a card with the author, date, and controls to view, copy, forward, quote, edit
    2. Adding practical and cool **extensible/plugable** MediaItems is one of the main goals!
 2. A **Call** is just a sequence of messages represented as **MediaItems** updated in real time
 3. A **SequenceView** looks like the familiar multimedia conversation in e.g. WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord
 4. For any MediaItem users can
    1. switch to a specialized tab to see/edit in full screen 
    2. some of this editors/viewers may be updated by other call participants, e.g. a scrum board
 5. The user must be able to control what **topic** is **giving attention** to e.g. to "autoplay" e.g. audios from ...
